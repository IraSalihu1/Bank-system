# Bank-System

This is Bank System RESTFul application.

Step 1.
    In your IDE locate the BankSystemApplication class and run it as a Java application.
    Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
    Using Swagger you can test the APIs.

Step 2. 
    Create a bank by giving the required information.

Step 3. 
    Create accounts with the name of the bank you created in step 1.
    If there is no bank with the given name, a message will be shown, saying that "Bank not found".

Step 3.
    You can do some transaction from one account to another.
    You can withdraw or deposit an amount of money into the account you created.

Step 4.
    You can see the list of transaction for a specific account.
    And some other APIs are created to get more information about the bank or the accounts.

Step 5.
    There is a test class (BankSystemApplicationTests) under the test folder hierarchy.
    There you will find 2 tests, and the rest of the tests are missing due to not having enough time to write them. :)
